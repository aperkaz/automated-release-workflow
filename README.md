This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), [commit-and-tag-version (for Changelog generation)](https://github.com/absolute-version/commit-and-tag-version) and multiple branching strategies, to support automated version releases.
